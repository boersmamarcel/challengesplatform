      We from Science Challenges would like you to share your expert knowlegde, or the knowledge in your organisation. 
      The best way to inspire students is with an expert in the field with valuable knowledge.
      You probably have a lot of challenging questions in your line of work and we offer you the opportunity to share these challenges with students.
      Let's assume you are an expert in the field of Big Data, you might offer students a challenge like 
      %i "Show what you can do with 6 Billion webpages".

          Drawing from our experience, it best is to align a challenge with the university schedule so a maximum of 8 weeks.
