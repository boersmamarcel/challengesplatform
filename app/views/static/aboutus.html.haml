      It is our mission to inspire students to discover and pursue their passion. Unlocking the full potential of students requires some innovation at universities. We decided to create a healthy community to stimulate the sharing of  knowledge between students, teachers and companies. We achieve this by offering challenges to small groups of passionate students, and stimulate them to work on the most awesome challenges our world has to offer with leading experts in the field.

Upon enrollment, a notification is sent when the challenges starts with detailed instructions. The participating students will, depending on the type and commitment of a challenge, spend several hours per week on a challenge. It is a unique opportunity for students to work with some of the leaders in the field.
